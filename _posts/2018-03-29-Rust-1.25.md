title: "Announcing Rust 1.25"
author: The Rust Core Team

The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.25.0. Rust is a
systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.25.0 is as easy as:

```bash
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for
1.25.0][notes] on GitHub.

## What's in 1.25.0 stable

Rust 1.25 contains a bunch of stuff! The first one is straightforward: we've
[upgraded to LLVM 6] from LLVM 4. This has a number of effects, a major one
being a step closer to AVR support.

A new way to write `use` statements has landed: [nested import groups]. If you've
ever written a set of imports like this:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
```

You can now write this:

```rust
// on one line
use std::{fs::File, io::Read, path::{Path, PathBuf}};

// with some more breathing room
use std::{
    fs::File,
    io::Read,
    path::{
        Path,
        PathBuf
    }
};
```

This can reduce some repetition, and make things a bit more clear.

There are two big documentation changes in this release: first, [Rust By
Example is now included on doc.rust-lang.org]! We'll be redirecing the old
domain there shortly. We hope this will bring more attention to a great
resource, and you'll get a local copy with your local documentation.

Second, back in Rust 1.23, we talked about the change from Hoedown to
pulldown-cmark. In Rust 1.25, pulldown-cmark is now the default rendering.
After years, we have finally removed the last bit of C from rustdoc, and
properly follow the CommonMark spec.

Finally, in [RFC 1358], `#[repr(align(x))]` was accepted. In Rust
1.25, [it is now stable]! This attribute lets you set the [alignment]
of your `struct`s:

```rust
struct NotAligned(i32);

assert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<NotAligned>(), 4);
assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<NotAligned>(), 4);

#[repr(align(16))]
struct Align16(i32);

assert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<Align16>(), 16);
assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Align16>(), 16);
```

If you're working with low-level stuff, control of these kinds of things
can be very important!

## Contributors to 1.25.0

Many people came together to create Rust 1.25. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. [Thanks!](https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.25.0)
