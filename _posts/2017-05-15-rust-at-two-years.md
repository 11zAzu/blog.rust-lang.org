* [Rust should have a lower learning curve](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/3)
* [Rust should have a pleasant edit-compile-debug cycle](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/1)
* [Rust should provide a solid, but basic IDE experience](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/2)
* [Rust should provide easy access to high quality crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/9)
* [Rust should be well-equipped for writing robust, high-scale servers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/10)
* [Rust should have 1.0-level crates for essential tasks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/11)
* [Rust should integrate easily into large build systems](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/12)
* [Rust's community should provide mentoring at all levels](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/13)


### Rust in numbers

A lot has happened since [Rust's first birthday]:

<!--
Will rerun these just before publishing:

commits:
`git log --since=2016-05-15 --until=2017-05-15 --oneline | wc`

contributors:
`git log --since=2016-05-15 --until=2017-05-15 --oneline --format="%aN" | sort | uniq | wc`

rfcs:
`git ls-tree a4a22d7c5dd71724bb2cd0fe2db5026338d0b270 text/ | wc` => there were 255 RFCs a year ago
`git ls-tree HEAD text/ | wc` => there are 310 RFCs now
310 - 255 =  55

crates:
`select count(*) from crates where date(created_at) >= '2016-05-15';`
-->

- 10,583 [commits] by 655 contributors added to the core repository;
- 55 [RFCs] merged;
- 9 major releases and 2 patch releases shipped;
- 4,303 new [crates] published;
- 284 library stabilizations;
- 3 babies born to people on [the Rust teams];
- 2 years of [stability delivered].

On an **average week** this year, the Rust community merged X RFCs and
published Y brand new [crates]. Not a single day went by without at least one
new Rust library hitting the central package manager. And Rust topped the
"[most loved] language" for the second year in a row in the StackOverflow survey.
