It's been two years since Rust 1.0 was released. Happy second birthday, Rust!

Rust, a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency,
has now achieved stability without stagnation by maintaining backwards
compatibility with version 1.0 for two years despite making many improvements.
Conveniently, Rust's birthday is a bit under halfway through 2017, which makes
this a great time to reflect not only on the progress in the last year but also
on the progress of our [2017 Roadmap] goals.

After reading this post, if you'd like to give us your feedback on how we're
doing and where Rust should focus next, please fill out our [2017 State of Rust
survey]!

But first, let's do the numbers!

### Rust in numbers

A lot has happened since [Rust's first birthday]:

<!--
Will rerun these just before publishing:

commits:
`git log --since=2016-05-15 --until=2017-05-15 --oneline | wc`

contributors:
`git log --since=2016-05-15 --until=2017-05-15 --oneline --format="%aN" | sort | uniq | wc`

rfcs:
`git ls-tree a4a22d7c5dd71724bb2cd0fe2db5026338d0b270 text/ | wc` => there were 255 RFCs a year ago
`git ls-tree HEAD text/ | wc` => there are 310 RFCs now
310 - 255 =  55

crates:
`select count(*) from crates where date(created_at) >= '2016-05-15';`

- 10,583 [commits] by 655 contributors added to the core repository;
- 55 [RFCs] merged;
- 9 major releases and 2 patch releases shipped;
- 4,303 new [crates] published;
- 284 library stabilizations;
- 10 languages [rust-lang.org] has been translated into;
- 48 new companies [running Rust in production][friends];
- 2 new teams (Docs and Style);
- 24 occasions of adding people to teams, 5 retirings of people from teams;
- 3 babies born to people on [the Rust teams];
- 2 years of [stability delivered].

On an **average week** this year, the Rust community merged 1 RFC and published
83 brand new [crates]. Rust topped the "[most loved] language" for the second
year in a row in the StackOverflow survey. Also new this year is
[thanks.rust-lang.org], a site where you can browse contributors by release!

### Rust 2017 Goals

* [Rust should have a lower learning curve](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/3)
* [Rust should have a pleasant edit-compile-debug cycle](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/1)
* [Rust should provide a solid, but basic IDE experience](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/2)
* [Rust should provide easy access to high quality crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/9)
* [Rust should be well-equipped for writing robust, high-scale servers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/10)
* [Rust should have 1.0-level crates for essential tasks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/11)
* [Rust should integrate easily into large build systems](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/12)
* [Rust's community should provide mentoring at all levels](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/13)

### Rust in production

npm
gnome

Mozilla, Rust's main sponsor, has accelerated their use of Rust in production.
Not only did [Servo start shipping nightly builds], [Firefox 48] marked the
first Firefox release that included Rust code as part of the [Oxidation]
project. [Project Quantum], announced in October 2016, is an effort to
incrementally adopt proven parts of Servo into Firefox's rendering engine,
Gecko.

### Rust, improved

- [Errors were updated to a new format](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35233)
- [The question mark operator was added](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31954)
- [Macros 1.1 enabled custom derive](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35957)
- [Rustbuild now uses Rust to build Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37817)
- [`cargo check` does a type check of a project without building it completely for faster feedback](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3296)

Compiler improvements are ongoing. This year, [MIR became a default part of the
compilation process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34096), which was a
prerequisite to unlocking further improvements.

Below is a table of [benchmarks] comparing the time it takes to compile a few
crates and tests with Rust 1.8.0 (the stable release a year ago) to Rust 1.17.0
(the stable release today). On average, compile times have improved by 5-10%,
but some worst-case behavior has been fixed that results in >95% improvements
in certain programs. A couple of crates did show a slight regression of 1-15%
in compile times, but in most cases it's a win. The helloworld crate saw a 110%
increase in compile time, but it only equates to +0.1 second, which is probably
a small fixed overhead that gets overwhelmed in any larger project.
