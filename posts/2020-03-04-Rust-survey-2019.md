![Do You Use Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/6-Have-You-Used-Rust.png)

About 75% of users indicated they were actively using Rust.

# Rust Users

First, let's go over the results for Rust users.

## **Time with Rust**

![How long have you worked in Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/7-How-Long-Worked-With-Rust.png)

We asked our users how long they had been working with Rust. The majority had been using Rust for 1-2 years. Overall these numbers were not significantly different from what we saw in 2018.

![How long did it take to be productive](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/8-How-Long-To-Be-Productive.png)

About 37% of Rust users felt productive in Rust in less than a month of use - this is not too different from the percentage last year (40%). Over 70% felt productive in their first year. Unfortunately, like last year, there is still a struggle among users - 21% indicated they did not yet feel productive.

![How long have you been unproductive](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/9-How-Long-Unproductive.png)

Additionally, many users indicated that they were not feeling comfortable in Rust - even after over 3 months of use. We need to find ways to help bridge users to productivity so they don't get stuck.

## **How much do you use Rust?**

![Size of summed Rust projects](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/10-Size-Of-Summed-projects.png)

The majority of Rust projects (43%) are 1,000-10,000 lines of code. Rust projects of medium to large size (those totally over 10k and 100k lines of code respectively) continue to trend higher. They have grown from 8.9% in 2016, to 16% in 2017, to 23% in 2018, to **34%** in 2019.

![How often do you use Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/11-How-Often-Use-Rust.png)

Rust daily usage has trended slightly upward at 27.63% (it was just under 25% last year and 17.5% on 2017). Users who use Rust daily or weekly has also continued to rend slight upward. This year it was 68.52%, last year it was 66.4%, and in 2017 it was 60.8%.

## **Rust expertise**

![How would you rate your Rust expertise](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/12-How-Rate-Rust-Expertise.png)

We also asked users how they would rate their Rust Expertise - there is a clear peak around "7".

![How would you rate your Rust expertise](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/13-Rust-Expertise-and-Time-In-Rust.png)

We compared these statistics with time spent using Rust. Rust expertise is highest at and after 1-2 years of experience.

![How difficult are Rust concepts](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/15-Rust-Concepts-Difficulty.png)

When it comes to Rust concepts, the results were similar to last year. Enums, Cargo, and Collections were relatively easy concepts, followed by Pattern Matching, Iterators, Modules, Closures, and Traits, and Concurrency. The most challenging concepts were Ownership, Generics & Trait Bounds, FFI, Async I/O (new this year), Unsafe, Macros, and Lifetimes.

## **Rust toolchain**

![Which Rust version do you use](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/16-Which-Rust-Version.png)

The vast majority of users use the current stable version of Rust (63%). Surprisingly, the number of users using the Nightly compiler in their workflow is down at 20%. Last year it was at over 56%.

![Preferred install method](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/17-Preferred-Install-Method.png)

We still see a very large percentage of users using `rustup` to install Rust, followed by Linux distros.

This year we asked about the upgrade to Rust 2018. 92.8% of our users who responded to the survey are using the 2018 edition of Rust. 85% of users said it took little work do do so.

![Comparative improvement](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/18-Comparative-Improvement.png)

Users indicated that ASYNC improved the most in Rust 2018, while GUI development and learning curve improved the least. Clearly we still have much to do to improve Rust's learning curve.

## **Rust workflow**

![Which platform are you developing on](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/15-Platform_developing_on.png)

Linux continues to be a powerhouse among Rust developers, holding on to roughly 80% of Rust developers.  Windows usage has grown slightly from 31% last year to 34% this year, its second year in a row of growth.

![Which platforms are you developing for](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/16-Platforms_targeting.png)

Linux and Windows continued to show strongly as targets for Rust applications. Other platforms held largely the same as last year, with one exception: WebAssembly. The new technology has showed impressive growth, nearly doubling from last year's 13% to this year's 24%.

![What editors do you use](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/17-Editors.png)

Vim, the front-runner in editors for two years has now finally been bested by VSCode, which grew from 33.8% of Rust developers to 44.4% this year.

## **Rust at work**

![Do you use Rust at work](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/18-Rust_at_work.png)

Rust continues is slow-and-steady growth in the workplace. We're now seeing year-over-year growth of full-time and part-time Rust, growing from last year's 4.4% full-time and 16.6% part-time to this year's **8.9% full-time** and **21.2% part-time**, a doubling of full-time Rust commercial use.  In total, Rust commercial use grew from 21% to just over 30% of Rust users.

![Is your company evaluating Rust](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/19-Company_evaluate_Rust.png)

There is more room for Rust to grow into more companies, over a third of which users report aren't currently looking into evaluating Rust in the coming year.  When paired with the survey data that said that nearly half of non-users needed the company support, this shows the need for further company outreach or more company-focused information about Rust.

## **Feeling welcome**

![Do you feel welcome in the Rust community](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/23-Do_you_feel_welcome.png)

An important part of the Rust community efforts are ensuring that the Rust project is a welcoming place for its users. New users should feel encouraged to explore, share ideas, and generally be themselves.

When asked, both current Rust users and non-users largely felt welcome, though over a quarter of responses weren't sure.  There was also some regional variation in these responses.  For example, responses on the Russian version of the survey showed double the percent of unwelcome feelings at 4%. Mainland China showed even more at 8%.

There's a challenge here to help Rust communities worldwide feel like they are part of what makes Rust unique, as Rust continues to grow a strong presence in more areas of the world.

![Are you underrepresented in tech](/images/2018-11-RustSurvey/24-Underrepresented.png)

The number of people in Rust who self-identify as being part of a group underrepresented in technology is growing slowly year-over-year. The survey also highlights some challenges, as the number of women is still lower than the industry average of women in programming fields.

# Rust Non-Users

A big part of a welcoming Rust community is reaching out to non-users as well. As we have in years past, we again asked the reasons why people weren't using Rust. 

For users who had used Rust before but had stopped using it, most had stopped using it within a year of starting.

![How long did you use Rust before you stopped?](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/3-How-Long-Before-Stopped-Rust.png)

When we asked why someone had stopped using Rust, the most common response was "My company doesn't use Rust."

![Why did you stop using Rust?](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/4-Why-Stopped-Rust.png)

For users who indicated they had never used Rust before, most indicated either "I haven't learned Rust yet, but I want to" or "My company doesn't use Rust".

# Challenges

As we've done in past years, we asked for your comments in where Rust can improve. This year, we see some familiar themes as well as some new ones in this feedback. The top ten themes this year are:

1. the need for better library support
2. a more improved IDE experience
3. the need for broader adoption of Rust generally
4. a richer ecosystem of tools and support
5. an improved learning curve
6. the need for important language features and crates to be stable and supported
7. support for async programming
8. support for GUI development
9. better documentation
10. improved compile times

New this year is the rising need to **support GUI development**, showing that Rust continues to grow not only on the server, but that people are feeling the need to stretch into application development.

> "Improve Rust marketing. Many people don't know about it"

Comments remind us that while Rust may be well-known in some circles, it still has room to grow and in many tech circles Rust may not yet be well-known. 

> "Keeping a focus on adoption/tutorials/books/novice experience will pay dividends in the years to come."

In addition to outreach, a broader set of documentation would in turn help reach a broader audience. 

> "Stability and maturity of developer tools, make it easier to get a working setup and to debug applications"

Many people commented on the IDE support, pointing out not only instability or inaccuracy in the RLS, but also the need for a much stronger IDE story that covered more areas, like easier debugging.

> "The maturity of the ecosystem and libraries. Have a good ecosystem of "standard" libraries is key for the future of the language"

A common theme continues to be the need to push libraries to completion and grow the set of "standard" libraries that users can use. Some comments point out this isn't the fault of maintainers, who are already working hard to write and publish the crates, but that generally more companies need to get involved and offer commercial support.

> "Ergonomics and discoverability of "putting it together" documentation"

Some people pointed out that ergonomics goes hand in hand with richer documentation, seeing that these aren't separate concepts but rather challenges that should be tackled together in a unified approach. 

## Looking forward

This year saw the strongest survey yet. Not only was it the largest community survey, it was the first to cover languages outside of English. Rust continues to grow steadily, and with it, both its strengths and challenges are introduced to a broader audience. 

We look forward to using your feedback in planning for 2019, and we're excited to see where we can take Rust next.
