Here is the language distribution of the responses we received.

* English: 69.6%
* Chinese: 10.8%
* German: 4.3%
* French: 3.3%
* Japanese: 3.0%
* Polish: 1.2%

![Do You Use Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/6-Have-You-Used-Rust.png)

About 75% of users indicated they were actively using Rust.

# Rust Users

First, let's go over the results for Rust users.

## **Time with Rust**

![How long have you worked in Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/7-How-Long-Worked-With-Rust.png)

We asked our users how long they had been working with Rust. The majority had been using Rust for 1-2 years. Overall these numbers were not significantly different from what we saw in 2018.

![How long did it take to be productive](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/8-How-Long-To-Be-Productive.png)

About 37% of Rust users felt productive in Rust in less than a month of use - this is not too different from the percentage last year (40%). Over 70% felt productive in their first year. Unfortunately, like last year, there is still a struggle among users - 21% indicated they did not yet feel productive.

![How long have you been unproductive](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/9-How-Long-Unproductive.png)

Additionally, many users indicated that they were not feeling comfortable in Rust - even after over 3 months of use. We need to find ways to help bridge users to productivity so they don't get stuck.

## **How much do you use Rust?**

![Size of summed Rust projects](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/10-Size-Of-Summed-projects.png)

The majority of Rust projects (43%) are 1,000-10,000 lines of code. Rust projects of medium to large size (those totally over 10k and 100k lines of code respectively) continue to trend higher. They have grown from 8.9% in 2016, to 16% in 2017, to 23% in 2018, to **34%** in 2019.

![How often do you use Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/11-How-Often-Use-Rust.png)

Rust daily usage has trended slightly upward at 27.63% (it was just under 25% last year and 17.5% on 2017). Users who use Rust daily or weekly has also continued to rend slight upward. This year it was 68.52%, last year it was 66.4%, and in 2017 it was 60.8%.

## **Rust expertise**

![How would you rate your Rust expertise](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/12-How-Rate-Rust-Expertise.png)

We also asked users how they would rate their Rust Expertise - there is a clear peak around "7".

![How would you rate your Rust expertise](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/13-Rust-Expertise-and-Time-In-Rust.png)

We compared these statistics with time spent using Rust. Rust expertise is highest at and after 1-2 years of experience.

![How difficult are Rust concepts](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/15-Rust-Concepts-Difficulty.png)

When it comes to Rust concepts, the results were similar to last year. Enums, Cargo, and Collections were relatively easy concepts, followed by Pattern Matching, Iterators, Modules, Closures, and Traits, and Concurrency. The most challenging concepts were Ownership, Generics & Trait Bounds, FFI, Async I/O (new this year), Unsafe, Macros, and Lifetimes.

## **Rust toolchain**

![Which Rust version do you use](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/16-Which-Rust-Version.png)

The vast majority of users use the current stable version of Rust (63%). Surprisingly, the number of users using the Nightly compiler in their workflow is down at 20%. Last year it was at over 56%.

![Preferred install method](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/17-Preferred-Install-Method.png)

We still see a very large percentage of users using `rustup` to install Rust, followed by Linux distros.

This year we asked about the upgrade to Rust 2018. 92.8% of our users who responded to the survey are using the 2018 edition of Rust. 85% of users said it took little work do do so.

![Comparative improvement](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/18-Comparative-Improvement.png)

Users indicated that async I/O improved the most in Rust 2018, no doubt related to the release of [async-await](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html), while GUI development and learning curve improved the least. Clearly we still have much to do to improve Rust's learning curve.

## **Rust workflow**

![Which platform are you developing on]()

51% of Rust users developed on Linux, while 24% developed on Windows, and 23% developed on macOS.

Linux continues to be a powerhouse among Rust developers, holding on to roughly 80% of Rust developers.  Windows usage has grown slightly from 31% last year to 34% this year, its second year in a row of growth.

![Which platforms are you developing for]()

Linux and Windows continue to dominate as targets for Rust applications - 55% of Rust users targeted Linux and 24.5% targeted Windows. Following close behind Windows are macOS and Web Assembly at 22% each.

![What editors do you use]()

Vim and VSCode continue to be the most popular editors (23.6% and 34.9% respectively) by far.

## Feeling welcome
We received a lot of feedback on how we can improve Rust and making it feel more welcome to more people. We can't include all of it here, so here is a summary of some of the feedback that stood out to us.

- People are in general asking for more learning material about Rust. In terms of expertise it's mainly beginner and intermediate level material being requested. A lot of these requests also asked for video content specifically.
- The common blockers that people mention to participating is that they have social anxiety, and accessibility. One of the common reasons mentioned was that some resources are hard to read for people with dyslexia.

# Rust Non-Users

A big part of a welcoming Rust community is reaching out to non-users as well. As we have in years past, we again asked the reasons why people weren't using Rust. 

For users who had used Rust before but had stopped using it, most had stopped using it within a year of starting.

![How long did you use Rust before you stopped?](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/3-How-Long-Before-Stopped-Rust.png)

When we asked why someone had stopped using Rust, the most common response was "My company doesn't use Rust."

![Why did you stop using Rust?](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/4-Why-Stopped-Rust.png)

For users who indicated they had never used Rust before, most indicated either "I haven't learned Rust yet, but I want to" or "My company doesn't use Rust".

# Challenges

As we've done in past years, we asked for your comments in where Rust can improve. This year, we see some familiar themes as well as some new ones in this feedback. The top ten themes for 2019 are:

1. Better training/documentation
2. More/Better Libraries
3. IDE Integration
4. Compilation Times
5. GUI Development
6. Async 
7. Generics 
8. Stabilization of Crates 
9. Web (support for/ focus on)
10. Borrow Checker

## Looking forward

![What are you excited about for 2020](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/19-Current-Users-Excited.png)

Finally, we asked our users what they are excited for in 2020. By fare the most popular option was Async/Await.
