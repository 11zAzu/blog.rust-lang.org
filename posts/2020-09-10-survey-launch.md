It's that time again! Time for us to take a look at how the Rust project is doing, and what we should plan for the future. The Rust Community Team is pleased to announce our [2020 State of Rust Survey][survey]! Whether or not you use Rust today, we want to know your opinions. Your responses will help the project understand its strengths and weaknesses and establish development priorities for the future. (If you'd like to give longer form feedback on the Rust roadmap, [we're also collecting blog posts!])

Completing this survey should take about 10–15 minutes and is anonymous unless you choose to give us your contact information. We will be accepting submissions for the next two weeks (until September 24th), and we will write up our findings afterwards to [blog.rust-lang.org]. You can also check out [last year’s results][2019 survey].

Finally, we wanted to thank everyone who helped develop, polish, and test the survey. In particular, we'd like to thank all of the volunteers who worked to provide all of the translations available this year and who will help to translate the results.
