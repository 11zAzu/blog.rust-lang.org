Hello everyone! 

On Tuesday 17 December the working group met and built an outline of an RFC to introduce project groups. 
You can see the detailed minutes at the link above, but here is a quick summary of what we would like to do: 

* Introduce the project group concept, creation workflow, and lifecycle
* Provide guidance for how project groups use RFCs

Goals served by introducing project groups include improved visibility into and follow-through on projects,
as well as supporting better documentation of the design process.

Our next meeting will be Jan 14. The topic is to be determined, but we plan to discuss that on January 7th informally.
