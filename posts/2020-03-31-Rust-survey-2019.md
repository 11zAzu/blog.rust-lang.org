Greetings Rustaceans!

We are happy to present the results of our fourth annual survey. 

## Survey Audience

The survey was available in **14** different languages and we received **3997** responses. 

![Rust Survey Language Distribution](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/1-Language-Breakdown.png)

Here is the language distribution of the responses we received.

* English: 69.6%
* Chinese: 10.8%
* German: 4.3%
* French: 3.3%
* Japanese: 3.0%
* Polish: 1.2%
* Portuguese: 1.2%
* Spanish: .9%
* Korean: .8%
* Italian: .6%
* Swedish: .5%
* Vietnamese: .2%

![Do You Use Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/6-Have-You-Used-Rust.png)

In the 2019 survey, 82.8% of responders indicated they used Rust, 7.1% indicated they did not currently use Rust but had used it in the past, and 10.1% indicated that they had never used Rust.

If we compare this to the 2018 survey (where 75% of responders indicated they used Rust, 8% indicated the did not currently use Rust but had used it in the past, and 8% indicated they had never used Rust) more responders were using Rust in 2019.

## Looking Back on Rust 2018

In December 2018 we released the Rust 2018 edition - Rust 1.31.0. In the 2019 survey, 92% of Rust users indicated they were using the new edition. 85% said that upgrading to the Rust 2018 edition was easy. 

![Comparative improvement](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/18-Comparative-Improvement.png)

Overall, many aspects of the Rust language were percieved as "somewhat better" in the 2018 edition.

## Conferences and Community

We noticed some differences between English language and other language results. Within the non-English language survey subset, the majority of the issues and concerns identified are the same as those within the English language. However, one concern/trend stands out among the non-English speaking subset - a desire for Rust documentation in their native language, or the language they took the survey in. This was particularly notable within the Chinese-language group, though that is likely due to the higher representation.

[ADD COPY about ongoing translation efforts]

We received a lot of feedback on how we can improve Rust and make it feel more welcoming to more people. We can't include all of it here, so here is a summary of some of the feedback that stood out to us.

People are in general asking for more learning material about Rust. In terms of expertise it's mainly beginner and intermediate level material being requested. A lot of these requests also asked for video content specifically.

The common blockers that people mention to participating is that they have social anxiety, and accessibility. One of the common reasons mentioned was that some resources are hard to read for people with dyslexia.

These issues are definitely ones we want to address in 2020 and beyond.

## Who is using Rust and what for?

![How long have you worked in Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/7-How-Long-Worked-With-Rust.png)

We found we have a lot of new folks coming in!

![Size of summed Rust projects](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/10-Size-Of-Summed-projects.png)

The majority of Rust projects (43%) are 1,000-10,000 lines of code. Rust projects of medium to large size (those totaling over 10k and 100k lines of code respectively) continue to trend higher. They have grown from 8.9% in 2016, to 16% in 2017, to 23% in 2018, to **34%** in 2019.

![How often do you use Rust](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/11-How-Often-Use-Rust.png)

Rust daily usage has trended slightly upward at 27.63% (it was just under 25% last year and 17.5% on 2017). Users who use Rust daily or weekly has also continued to rend slight upward. This year it was 68.52%, last year it was 66.4%, and in 2017 it was 60.8%.

![How would you rate your Rust expertise](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/12-How-Rate-Rust-Expertise.png)

We also asked users how they would rate their Rust Expertise - there is a clear peak around "7".

## Why not use Rust?

A big part of a welcoming Rust community is reaching out to non-users as well. As we have in years past, we again asked the reasons why people weren't using Rust. 

![How long did you use Rust before you stopped?](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/3-How-Long-Before-Stopped-Rust.png)

For users who had used Rust before but had stopped using it, most had stopped using it within a year of starting.

![Why did you stop using Rust?](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/4-Why-Stopped-Rust.png)

When we asked why someone had stopped using Rust, the most common response was "My company doesn't use Rust" - which indicates Rust adoption is still the biggest reason. After that, learning curve, lack of needed libraries, being slowed down by switching to Rust, and lack of IDE support were the most common reasons a user stopped using Rust.

![Why have you never used Rust?](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/5-Why-Never-Used-Rust.png)

For users who indicated they had never used Rust before, most indicated either "I haven't learned Rust yet, but I want to" or "My company doesn't use Rust".

![I would use Rust more often if...](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/20-Would-use-rust-more-often-if.png)

We also asked users what would lead them to use Rust more often. Most indicated they would use Rust more if their company adopted it, if Rust had more libraries that they need, and if IDE support was better. The most common reasons after those pointed to a need to improve the learning curve and interoperability. 

## Rust Adoption - a Closer Look

Let's dig deeper into issues with Rust adoption.

![How can we make Rust more appealing to your company](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/21-Rust-more-appealing.png)

Most indicated that Rust maturity - such as more libraries and complete learning resources and more mature production capabilities - would make Rust more appealing.

Several users gave examples of things that would make Rust more appealing:
* "Smoothest learning curve as possible, as a small business even 4-6 weeks to become productive is a lot to ask"
* "Higher market penetration"
* "More stable libraries"
* "A full-stack web framework like Rails, Django and Phoenix"
* "Better documentation, more examples, recommendation on what crates to use"
* "More emphasis on how it is a safer alternative to C or C++ (and really should be the default usually).‚Äù
* "Improve compile times. Compiling development builds at least as fast as Go would be table stakes for us to consider Rust. (Release builds can be slow."
* "Better platform support"
* "Security and performance, cost efficient and "green" (low carbon footprint) language"
* "Embedded development targeting ARM"
* "Better GUI framework, similar to Qt or directly using Qt via bindings."

## Libraries - a Closer Look

When we asked users what libraries they consider critical to the Rust ecosystem, these were the top ten responses:
* serde
* rand
* tokio
* async
* clap
* regex
* log
* futures
* hyper
* lazy_static

We also asked how many dependencies users were using were 1.0 or above.
* 0.8% indicated "All"
* 6.7% indicated "Most"
* 65.9% indicated "Some"
* 5.2% indicated "None"
* 21.4% indicated "I don't know"

## IDEs and Tooling - a Closer Look

When we asked users what editors they use, Vim and VSCode were the most popular by far, followed by Intellij.

We also asked what IDE setups users used:
* 43.3% indicated RLS
* 21.7% indicated Intellij
* 15.2% indicated Rust-analyzer
* 12.4% indicated No (or CTAGS)
* 4.2% indicated Only Racer

As for platforms that users develop on - Linux and Windows continue to dominate. 
* 55% of Rust users develop on Linux
* 24% develop on Windows
* 23% develop on macOS

![Which Rust version do you use for your applications?](images/2020-03-RustSurvey/16-Which-Rust-Version.png)

The vast majority of users use the current stable version of Rust (63%). Surprisingly, the number of users using the Nightly compiler in their workflow is down at 20%. Last year it was at over 56%.

## Learning Curve - a Closer Look

![How would you rate your Rust expertise](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/13-Rust-Expertise-and-Time-In-Rust.png)

Next, we compared "how expert" users feel when using Rust, compared with statistics about time spent using Rust. Rust expertise is highest at and after 1-2 years of experience. This is consistent with the results of previous surveys.

![How long did it take to be productive](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/8-How-Long-To-Be-Productive.png)

About 37% of Rust users felt productive in Rust in less than a month of use - this is not too different from the percentage last year (40%). Over 70% felt productive in their first year. Unfortunately, like last year, there is still a struggle among users - 21% indicated they did not yet feel productive.

![How long have you been unproductive](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/9-How-Long-Unproductive.png)

Additionally, many users indicated that they were not feeling comfortable in Rust - even after over 3 months of use. This is likely a result of Rust's high learning curve.

This may also be an issue with language complexity, but it might also be related to tooling or other obstacles (integrated development environments in particular). This is a good place for us to investigate through follow-up surveys and other work.

![Expertise level of respondents who don't feel productive yet](/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/22-unproductive-expertise.png)

As a point of interest, we took the subset of users who don't feel productive yet and plotted their ratings of their Rust expertise. This indicates that people who don't feel productive had low to mid levels of expertise.
