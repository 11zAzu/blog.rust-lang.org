# Announcing the Project Director Nominees

After a couple of weeks of soliciting nominees from the Rust Project for potential new Project Directors, we are happy to present the list of nominees. Please note that none of these have been *elected* to the position yet. These are the people who the Leadership Council will consider as we work to elect three new Project Directors.

Without further ado, the nominees are:

- Mara Bos
- lcnr
- TC
- Felix
- Michael Goulet
- Jubilee
- Jakob Degen
- scottmcm
- Santiago Pastorino
- Amanieu

These were all spoken of highly by their nominating teams. While several other candidates were suggested, not everyone who was nominated felt like they were in a place where they were able or wanted to accept the role if they were elected.

Now we'd again like to ask the members of the Rust Project for their feedback. Please let us know if there's anything we should consider going into the election process. We hope that most of the feedback will be reasons we may not have considered yet for why they will be successful in the role, but if there are areas of necessary growth or other concerns that mean one or more of these nominees may not be a good fit for the role at this time, we want to know this as well!

You may reach out to us either on the public #council channel on Zulip, through <council@rust-lang.org>, or you may DM any council member on Zulip.

We will be open for feedback through October 2, and elections will take place soon afterwards. We will announce the new Project Directors once the election is complete.
