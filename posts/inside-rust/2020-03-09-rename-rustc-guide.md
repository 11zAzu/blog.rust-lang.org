You may or may not be aware of two similarly named resources:
- [The rustc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html)
- [The rustc-guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-dev-guide/)

What's difference? The "rustc book" is intended as a guide for _users_ of the
compiler. The "rustc-guide" is intended as a guide for _developers_ of the
compiler. However, the names have always been confusingly similar.

**For that reason, we have decided to rename the `rustc-guide` to
`rustc-dev-guide`.**

We have put significant work into finding and updating links around the
`rust-lang/*` repos. We have also put up a website in place of the former
`rustc-guide` website that points to the book and rustc-dev-guide.

You can find more information in [this issue][gh]. If you have any questions or
concerns, please feel free to contact us either by opening an [issue on the
rustc-dev-guide repo][repo] or on our [zulip channel][zulip].
