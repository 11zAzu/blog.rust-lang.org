The theme of April's CTCFT is "learning". Doc Jones will speak about the Rustc
Reading Club Phase II, and what was learned from the first iteration of the
club. Jon Gjengset will talk about teaching advanced Rust concepts.

- (15 min) Rustc Reading Club Phase II ([doc-jones])

## Afterwards: Social Hour

Like always, we'll be running a social hour after the CTCFT. The idea is really
simple: for the hour after the meeting, we will create breakout rooms in Zoom
with different themes. You can join any breakout room you like and hangout.
