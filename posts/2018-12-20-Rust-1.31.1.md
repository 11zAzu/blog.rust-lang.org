The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.31.1. Rust is a
systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.31.1 is as easy as:

```
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for
1.31.1][notes] on GitHub.

[install]: https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html
[notes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1311-2018-12-20

## What's in 1.31.1 stable

This patch release fixes a build failure on on `powerpc-unknown-netbsd` by
way of [an update to the `libc`
crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56562) used by the compiler.

Additionally, the Rust Language Server was updated to fix two critical bugs:

* <https://github.com/rust-lang/rls/issues/1171>
* <https://github.com/rust-lang/rls/pull/1170>
