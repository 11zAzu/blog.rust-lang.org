Hello Rust community!

We're excited to announce that the Rust project teams be hosting an
unconference[^1] the day after RustConf.

The PostConf Unconf will be dedicated to the Rust project and will be a
fantastic opportunity for users, contributors, and maintainers to network and
discuss the project's development.

There will be no set agenda; instead, attendees will decide what will be
discussed together and can move freely between sessions to find ones in which
they can contribute most effectively based on their individual interests and
needs.

To get the most out of the unconference, jot down your thoughts ahead of time
and bring them ready to share. We will also set up a channel in the RustConf
Discord for folks to communicate and make preliminary, informal plans.

If you plan to attend, please register as soon as possible to help us plan
appropriately. If space is limited, project participants and conference
attendees will be given preference. Registration is free and open to everyone,
but we require either a RustConf registration ID or a $10 deposit at signup to
ensure that registrations are an accurate approximation of participants.

**[:rotating_light: Register Now! :rotating_light:]()**

We hope to see you there!
