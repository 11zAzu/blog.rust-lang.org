Hello Rust community!

We're excited to announce that the Rust project teams be hosting an
unconference[^1] the day after RustConf. This unconference will be dedicated to
the Rust project and will be a fantastic opportunity for users, contributors,
and maintainers to network and discuss the project's development.

There will be no set agenda; instead, attendees will decide what will be
discussed together and can move freely between sessions to find ones in which
they can contribute most effectively based on their individual interests and
needs.

To get the most out of the unconference, jot down your thoughts ahead of time
and bring them ready to share. We will also setup a Discord channel for folks
to communicate and make preliminary, informal plans.

Whether or not you plan to attend, please fill out the extremely short two
question **[:rotating_light: attendance survey :rotating_light:]()** so we can
better estimate the number of attendees, especially if you are a project
member. We have no data to base figures off of because we have never hosted an
event like this, especially during COVID Times, and completing the survey will
help us plan appropriately, even if your answer is just "I'm definitely not
going" or "I'm undecided".

Everyone is welcome to register, but if space is limited, registration for
project participants and conference attendees will be given priority.

We hope to see you there!
